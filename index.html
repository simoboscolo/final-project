			<h1>to Rome, by bike</h1>
			<p class="text">Never taught i was going to do it, but eventually when my friends asked me: "hey wanna come by bike to Rome this summer?" i answered "yeah, why not?". Well, Spoiler Alert: We did it. No preparation at all, 700 km, 12 days and a bit too much money later we were eating spaghetti cacio e pepe. Totally worth it.

					<p class="clear">Step 1: take the bike. Step 2: bike. It sounded easy and honestly the first day was not quite chill. Eventually we learned it's important to have water with you at all times because apparently it's impossible to get it when you're biking in the middle of nothing in the Italian Countryside.</p>
					<p>We also learned you can't bike on sand so there was a lot of walking and Google Maps became our best friend. The sand was ending 'over there' every five minutes, only that it was actually not.</p>
					<p>On top of it a little extra shortcut made our first day something like 10km longer. Lesson number 3 is do not shortcut.</p>
					<p>We arrived at Orio Litta around Dinner time and, as we contacted the major during the day, we stayed at the town hall for the night. Lucky thing is, there was a small city fair, so we relaxed with a beer and funky live music in the evening.</p>

					<p class="clear">The Second day was fun! We started biking early in the morning and soon realized the Po Valley was over. We were going up!</p>
					<p>I didn't mind it as much as my friends, they spent 8 hours complaining.</p>
					<p>At the first decent city we stop to have a look around and here we meet Susan. She was staying at the city hall as well. She was like us travelling but not on a bike, she was walking. She was from New Zeland and alike us she had so much energy i don't even know how to decribe it! She explained us she started walking from Spain and then went up to North Cape and then came down to Italy and after reaching Rome she will go back up and go to Gerusalem. All Walking. She started 2 years before we met her in 2013, so i guess she should be in Israel about now?</p>
					<p>She plays for us a beatiful song with the flute and then she's off again walking. I still don't know where she was getting the energy from!</p>
					<p>After lunch we start biking again going up and up, legs hurting. As a reward we decided to stop for the night in a small thermal village, in a nice resort, have some good food enjoying music.</p>
